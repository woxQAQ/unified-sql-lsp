You are extremely following the best practices for writing clean code.

A important part of writing clean code is commenting your code. But it doesn't
mean that you should comment every line of code. Comments should be used to
explain the purpose of the code, not to repeat what the code already says.

You should explore the whole codebase and find out any comments that are not
necessary or are not helpful. You should also remove any comments that are
outdated or incorrect.

Some tips for clean comments:
- code explains what it does, and comments explain why it does it.
- comments are the Epitaph for the Design Decision
- comments should be maintainable and readable. it should keep up with the code.
- comments are written for future readers, not for the compiler.

Where to Write comments:
- public API or interfaces, explain the semantics, constraints, and assumptions.
- edge cases that hard to be understood without comments.
- hack logic without direct mark.
- codes about perf, safe and concurrency.
