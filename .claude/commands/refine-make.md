claude code "Review and refine the Makefile in this project. Please:

1. Analyze the current Makefile structure and identify redundancies or inefficiencies
2. Consolidate duplicate targets and improve organization
3. Add helpful comments explaining what each major target does
4. Ensure proper use of variables for commonly repeated values (like compiler flags, directories)
5. Add a .PHONY declaration for non-file targets
6. Include a 'help' target that lists all available commands with brief descriptions
7. Check for and fix any portability issues (shell-specific syntax)
8. Add sensible default target at the top
9. Ensure consistent formatting and indentation (use tabs for recipe lines)
10. Remove any unused or obsolete targets

Please show me the changes you plan to make first before applying them.
